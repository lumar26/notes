Objašnjenje CORS-a:

CORS is a browser mechanism that asks webserver if it is willing to accept request from specific origin. Origin is your hostname + port, meaning localhost:3000, localhost:4200 and localhost:8000 are all different origins.

You can either configure header Access-Control-Allow-Origin on your backend side to accept requests from 'localhost:3000', or you can start your react application on port :4200, since it is already accepted by your backend, or you can use proxy that will make requests to backend from server side.

In production environment you usually have backend and frontend working on same origin, so proxy is a good way to solve CORS problems during development. You also can setup some reverse proxy, like nginx, so your backend and frontend would both be on same origin.
